# 🧠 Face Recognition Attendance System with Python & OpenCV

Welcome to the **Face Recognition Attendance System**, an intelligent desktop application built with Python that leverages real-time facial recognition to mark and record attendance — no manual input required!

> 🚀 _“Bringing automation to the classroom and workplace with AI-driven face recognition.”_

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition** using `OpenCV`  
✅ **Add New Faces on the Fly** with `add_faces.py`  
✅ **Attendance Logging** with timestamps stored in CSV format  
✅ **Simple GUI Integration** using `Tkinter`  
✅ **Auto-Creation of Face Data** using a camera feed  
✅ **Visual Feedback with Background UI**  
✅ **Test Mode** (`test.py`) for rapid model validation  
✅ **Clean Project Structure** and modular code  
✅ **Easy to Extend** for schools, companies, or events

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Run `add_faces.py`**  
   ➤ Capture and save new face images under a name of your choice.

2. **Run `app.py`**  
   ➤ Starts the recognition interface using your webcam.  
   ➤ logs attendance when a known face is detected after pressing "O".

3. **View Attendance**  
   ➤ CSV logs with timestamped entries can be found in the `Attendance/` folder.

4. **Run `test.py`**  
   ➤ A quick way to test face recognition separately without logging.
